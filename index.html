        Experienced Technical Lead with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software 
        industry. Skilled in Software development, Team Building, Functional Management, Java, and 
        Rational DOORS. Strong engineering professional with a MS focused in Computer Science 
        from National University. I have worked with C++ and Java programming languages for most of
        my career. In 2014, my manager asked me to hire some new grads at Northrop Grumman. I
        interviewed many candidates and one thing I realized is that I was becoming ancient in this 
        industry. So I decided to quit that job and find something new and be on-hands programming
        lead position.
